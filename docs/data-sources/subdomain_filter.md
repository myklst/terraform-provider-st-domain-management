# st-domain-management_subdomain_filter (Data Source)

Query subdomains that satisfy the filter using Terraform Data Source.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "st-domain-management_subdomain_filter" "example" {
  domain_labels = {
    include = {
      "common/brand" = "sige" # Data source will return only domains that belong to sige AND
      "common/env"   = "test" # domains that are used in testing env only.
    }
    exclude = {
      "common/status" = "deleted" # Data source filter will ignore any domains whose status label is deleted 
    }
  }

  subdomain_labels = {
    include = {
      "uncommon/testing" = true # Only return subdomains that contains this label and this value
    }
    exclude = { # Don't exclude any labels
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `domain_labels` (Object) Labels filter. Only domains that contain these labels will be returned as data source output. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--domain_labels))
- `subdomain_labels` (Object) Subdomain labels filter. Only subdomains that contain these labels will be returned as data source output (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--subdomain_labels))

### Optional

- `domain_annotations` (Object) Annotations filter. Only domains that contain these annotations will be returned as data source output. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--domain_annotations))

### Read-Only

- `domains` (Dynamic) List of domains that match the given filter.
Each domain has a subdomains list.
Each subdomain in the list has name fqdn, and a labels object that can be accessed via its dot notation.
e.g. `domains[0].subdomains[0].labels["common/env"]`
Additionally, each domain has a metadata object that can be accessed via its dot notation.
e.g. `domains[0].metadata.labels["common/env"]`
