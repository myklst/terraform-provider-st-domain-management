# st-domain-management_subdomain_filter (Data Source)

Query subdomains that satisfy the filter using Terraform Data Source.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "st-domain-management_subdomain_filter" "example" {
  domain_labels = {
    include = {
      "common/brand" = "sige" # Data source will return only domains that belong to sige AND
      "common/env"   = "test" # domains that are used in testing env only.
    }
    exclude = {
      "common/status" = "deleted" # Data source filter will ignore any domains whose status label is deleted 
    }
  }

  subdomain_labels = {
    include = {
      "uncommon/testing" = true # Only return subdomains that contains this label and this value
    }
    exclude = { # Don't exclude any labels
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `domain_annotations` (Object) Annotations filter. Only domains that contain these annotations will be returned as data source output. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--domain_annotations))
- `domain_labels` (Object) Labels filter. Only domains that contain these labels will be returned as data source output. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--domain_labels))
- `subdomain_labels` (Object) Subdomain labels filter. Only subdomains that contain these labels will be returned as data source output (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--subdomain_labels))

### Read-Only

- `domains` (Dynamic) List of domains that match the given filter.
Each element contains the following attributes:
  - `domain` - The name of this domain
  - `metadata` - All the metadata of this domain
    - `labels` - JSON key value pair
    - `annotations` - JSON key value pair
  - `subdomains` - List of all the subdomains of this domain. 
If `subdomain_labels` is not null, only filtered subdomains are present. 
Each element contains the following attributes:
    - `name` - The name of this subdomain
    - `fqdn` - The fully qualified domain name.
    - `metadata` - All the metadata of this domain
      - `labels` - JSON key value pair

Labels or annotations can be accessed via dot notation
e.g. `domains[0].metadata.labels["common/env"]`
Labels for each subdomain can also be accessed via dot notation
e.g. `domains[0].subdomains[0].metadata.labels["feature_a/enable"]`
