## Schema

### Required

- `domain_labels` (String) Domain labels filter. Only domains that contain these labels will be returned as data source output.
- `subdomain_labels` (String) Subdomain labels filter. Only subdomains that contain these labels will be returned as data source output

### Optional

- `domain_annotations` (String) Annotations filter. Only domains that contain these annotations will be returned as data source output.

### Read-Only

- `domains` (Dynamic) List of domains that match the given filter.
Each domain has a subdomains list.
Each subdomain in the list has name fqdn, and a labels object that can be accessed via its dot notation.
e.g. `domains[0].subdomains[0].labels["common/env"]`
Additionally, each domain has a metadata object that can be accessed via its dot notation.
e.g. `domains[0].metadata.labels["common/env"]`
